  <Frame>
    ![docs.json screenshot](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/changelog/docsjson.png)
  </Frame>

  We've introduced a new `docs.json` schema as a replacement for `mint.json`, to support better multi-level versioning, easier visual comprehension, and more consistent terminology. For more information on what's changed, [check out our blog](https://mintlify.com/blog/refactoring-mint-json-into-docs-json).

  Upgrade from `mint.json` to `docs.json` with the following steps:

  1. Make sure your CLI is the latest version

  ```
  npm i mint@latest -g
  ```

  1. In your docs repository, run

  ```
  mint upgrade
  ```

  1. Delete your old mint.json file and push your changes

  ## CI Checks

  Automatically lint your docs to find broken links, discover spelling and grammar issues, or enforce writing styles with your own Vale config. Learn more in our [docs](settings/ci).

  ## .md support for LLMs

  All documentation pages are now automatically available as plain Markdown files—just append `.md` to the URL. This makes it easier for LLMs to ingest individual pages from your documentation.

  ## More Themes
