Welcome to **PayNext Webhooks** - your comprehensive solution for receiving real-time notifications about important events in the system, such as payment updates or subscription changes.

## Quick Start

Set up an event destination to receive real-time events through an HTTPS webhook URL. Once your webhook endpoint is registered, our system will automatically send event notifications to it whenever relevant actions occur in your account. This allows your application to react to updates—like payments, subscriptions, or refund—as they happen.

#### Setup Your Webhook Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook Endpoint">
    <Expandable title="Implementation steps">
      - Create a new endpoint in your application at `/webhooks/paynext`
      - Configure POST method to handle incoming requests
      - Extract event data from request body
      - Process events based on type (payment, subscription)
      - Always respond with 200 status code for successful processing

      ```javascript
      app.post('/webhooks/paynext', (req, res) => {
        const { event, object, type, data } = req.body;

        switch(event) {
          case 'payment.created':
            // Do something
            break;
          case 'subscription.created':
            // Do something
            break;
        }

        res.status(200).send('OK');
      });
      ```
