## Customers Tab

The Customers tab provides centralized access to every customer profile in your system:

- View all subscriptions, statuses, and history for each user
- See most recent payments, billing method, and plan
- Filter by subscription state (Trial, Active, Cancelled)
- Search by email, ID, or reference
- Manually create or cancel subscriptions
- Inspect past payments, including card brand, status, and timestamp

<Note>
Each customer page acts as a full billing record, with easy access to subscription controls and refund actions.

## Routing Rule Management

From the CRM, users can:

- Add or update routing rules to direct payments to specific processors
- Control rules by PSP, country, currency, or amount range
- Fetch or delete rules as needed

<Tip>
Routing rules enable sophisticated payment orchestration, allowing you to optimize for success rates, costs, and geographic preferences.

## Logs & Monitoring

You can inspect activity logs directly in the payment timeline, available in the CRM.

**This includes key events like:**

- Payment processing attempts
- Subscription updates
- Webhook delivery status

<Note>
These logs help you understand and troubleshoot payment flows within PayNext.

The CRM transforms complex billing operations into an intuitive interface, empowering your team to manage customers, resolve issues, and optimize payment performance without technical intervention.
