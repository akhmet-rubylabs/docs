<Note>
If you're new to PayNext, we recommend starting with the [Core Concepts](../introduction/core-concepts) section to understand how the platform is structured.
</Note>

---

## Step 1. Connect your Payment Processor

To process payments, you need to configure a payment provider (PSP) in your PayNext organization.

### What is a Payment Provider?

A payment provider (like Stripe) enables you to charge cards, wallets, or alternative methods. PayNext lets you connect to test and live payment providers via API.

### Connect a Test PSP

By default, your sandbox account includes access to a Test PSP that mimics real payment behavior (success, decline, refund).

<Tip>
You can also configure production PSPs as your go-live date approaches.
</Tip>

## Step 2. Generate Your API Key

Every API request to PayNext requires a secure **API key**.

**To generate it:**

<Steps>
<Step title={'Log into your PayNext Dashboard'}>
Access your organization's dashboard with your admin credentials.
</Step>

<Step title={'Navigate to API Keys'}>
Go to `Developers → API Keys`
</Step>

<Step title={'Create a new secret key'}>
Generate a new API key for your integration.
</Step>

<Step title={'Use it in the Authorization header'}>
Include the key in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Never expose secret keys in frontend code.
</Warning>

## Step 3. Create a Plan

Before accepting recurring payments, define your billing logic by creating subscription plans.

From the dashboard, go to the Plans section and click Create a New Plan. You can configure:

- **Plan Type**: Recurring or one-off
- **Billing Period**: Set how often the customer is charged
- **Renewal Pricing**: Set price and currency (supporting multiple currencies)
- **Trial Period (optional)**: Offer a free trial before billing starts

<Note>
Each plan defines how and when your customers are charged these are later referenced in your API calls during checkout.
</Note>

## Step 4. Configure Webhooks

Webhooks allow your system to stay in sync with payment or subscription events.

PayNext supports different real-time notifications, you can check it under [Webhooks Guide](../../webhooks/introduction/getting-started).

**To configure:**

<Steps>
<Step title={'Go to Developers → Webhooks'}>
Navigate to the webhooks section in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title={'Add your server URL'}>
Provide the endpoint URL where PayNext should send event notifications.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5. Run a Test Payment

To simulate a full checkout flow, you must use the PayNext SDK integrated on your frontend.

Every test payment follows these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title={'Create a client session from your backend using the API'}>
Initialize a payment session with your desired parameters.
</Step>

<Step title={'Initialize the SDK on the frontend using the client session ID'}>
Load the PayNext SDK with the session identifier.
</Step>

<Step title={'Complete the payment using a test card, wallet, or PayPal'}>
Use test payment methods like `4242 4242 4242 4242` for a successful card transaction.

<CodeGroup>
```text Test Card Number
4242 4242 4242 4242
```

```text Expected Result
Successful transaction
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

After completing the payment:

- The payment status will update (`settling`, `settled`)
- If tied to a subscription, the subscription status will reflect `trial` or `active`
- You can view these updates directly within the CRM under the relevant customer profile

<Check>
Make sure your webhook endpoint receives the event notification for full confirmation.
</Check>

## Step 6. Monitor and Explore Payments

You can track all payment activity in two ways:

**Dashboard**: Access the "Payments" tab to browse and filter payments  
**API**: Refer to our [Public API docs](../../api-reference/introduction/getting-started) for more details.

With these integration steps complete, you're ready to start processing real payments and managing customer subscriptions through PayNext.
