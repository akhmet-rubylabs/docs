## Key Steps to Get Started

<Steps>
<Step title={'Create Your PayNext Account'}>
  Set up your organization and merchant account inside the PayNext dashboard. Define your business profile, choose your primary currency, and optionally link your first Payment Service Provider (PSP).
</Step>

<Step title={'Generate API Keys'}>
From the dashboard, create your API keys to start sending secure requests. Use your secret keys only in backend environments and never expose them on the frontend.

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title={'Choose Your Integration Method'}>
PayNext offers flexible integration paths:

- **Direct API**
- **SDKs**
- **Pre-built UI components**

Select the method that best fits your product's architecture and payment logic.
</Step>

<Step title={'Understand the Core Concepts'}>
Before integrating, review the fundamentals of PayNext's data model:

- **Organizations**: Your company and settings
- **Users**: Logged-in admins who access the dashboard
- **Customers**: Your end users (linked to payment methods and subscriptions)
- **Payments**: One-time or recurring charges
- **Plans**: Pricing structures for subscriptions
- **Subscriptions**: Billing cycles tied to customers

<Tip>
Understanding these concepts will streamline your integration and data flow setup.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title={'Configure Environments'}>
Start with our sandbox mode to test all flows safely. When you are ready, switch to production mode to accept live payments and subscriptions.
</Step>

<Step title={'Configure Webhooks'}>
Webhooks allow PayNext to notify your server automatically when important events happen such as payment status changes, refunds or similar. This ensures your system stays in sync without manual polling.

**To set up a webhook:**

1. Go to the Developers section in the PayNext dashboard.
2. Open the Webhooks tab and click Add Webhook.
3. Provide a name and the URL of your server endpoint that will handle incoming `POST` requests.

<Check>
Failed webhook attempts are retried automatically. Make sure your endpoint responds with a `2XX` status to acknowledge delivery.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title={'Configure Checkout Form'}>
Use the **PayNext Dashboard** to customize your checkout form with the exact payment methods and display logic you need all without writing a single line of code.

**Steps to configure:**

1. **Enable Payment Methods**  
   Toggle on options like PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Card from the Checkout section. Enabled methods appear instantly in your form preview.

2. **Set Display Rules (Optional)**  
   Click on any payment method to access its settings. Use the Condition Builder to define when a method should be shown. You can conditionally display methods based on:  
   Order country, Currency and amount, Metadata values passed in your session

3. **Customize Method Order**  
   Drag and drop payment methods in the left panel to control the order in which they appear to users.

4. **Preview in Real Time**  
   As you configure, view changes instantly in the live checkout form preview.

5. **Save and Publish**  
   Click Save to apply your configuration and make it available across your integrated checkout.

<Note>
This gives you full control over the payment experience adapting to different geographies, customer segments, or transaction types, all directly from your dashboard.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title={'Test Everything'}>
Use test cards, client session logic, and webhook triggers to simulate real-world scenarios. Full error abstraction helps you distinguish between soft and hard declines [link].

You can also use Stripe's test card [link] to trigger specific responses and edge cases during your testing phase.
</Step>
</Steps>
