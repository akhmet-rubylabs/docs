## Key Building Blocks

### 1. Payment Orchestration Engine

At its core, PayNext allows you to create flexible, API-driven payment flows that support:

- One-time payments
- Recurring billing with trials
- Retry logic (dunning) and error handling
- Soft/hard decline mapping
- Currency-based plan pricing

<Info>
Payments are processor-agnostic, meaning you can integrate with your preferred PSP and PayNext will normalize the response, error, and lifecycle logic on top.
</Info>

Each payment moves through a unified status lifecycle, including:

- `PENDING` – Payment is awaiting the next step (e.g. callback, confirmation).
- `AUTHORIZED` – Funds have been authorized but not yet settled.
- `SETTLING` / `SETTLED` – Funds are in the process of being or have been successfully settled.
- `FAILED` / `DECLINED` – Payment failed to process or was rejected by the processor.
- `CANCELLED` – Payment was cancelled before completion.

### 2. Subscription Management System

PayNext comes with a powerful subscription engine built to support:

- Multi-tiered plans (one-time and recurring)
- Past-due management (dunning)
- Full plan and billing logic defined per currency and region

<Tip>
Unlike rigid billing platforms, PayNext gives you full control over how subscriptions are created, updated, and cancelled with clean APIs and webhook support.
</Tip>

### 3. Built-in CRM

PayNext is one of the few orchestration platforms with a native CRM layer, allowing you to:

- View all customer details, payment history, and subscription status
- Trigger actions or automations based on real-time data
- Enrich and filter customer records across products, plans, and statuses

<Check>
This is particularly powerful for teams building internal dashboards or operational portals. No external CRM syncing required, everything lives inside PayNext.

Whether you are a SaaS company managing trials, a platform launching in multiple regions, or a FinTech product needing full payment transparency, PayNext is built to be your payment OS.

You will find in this documentation how each concept ties together, from subscriptions and payments to workflows, webhooks, and the CRM to help you ship faster with full control.
