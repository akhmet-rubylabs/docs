Understanding and effectively managing payment decline codes is crucial for optimizing transaction success rates and providing a smooth customer experience.

PayNext unifies various provider-specific decline codes into a standardized system, categorizing them as either **Soft Declines** or **Hard Declines**.

## Unified Error Payload Structure and Decline Code Mapping

Regardless of the original payment provider, all payment errors within PayNext are transformed into a unified JSON structure. This standardized payload ensures consistent error analysis and handling.

### Key Fields in the Unified Error Payload

- **`message`**: A human-readable description of the error.
- **`decline_type`**: Indicates the category of the decline â€” either `HARD_DECLINE` or `SOFT_DECLINE`.
- **`code`**: A normalized reason code (e.g., `UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`, `CARD_EXPIRED`).

<Note>
This structure is associated with the corresponding payment record to enable observability and auditing.
</Note>

<Check>
PayNext uses custom mapping functions to normalize provider-specific error codes, ensuring consistency across all integrated payment gateways.

## Conceptual Decline Code Mapping Table

Understanding how various decline codes map to soft or hard declines is key to managing payment failures effectively. While the full list is available in the PayNext API Reference, the conceptual mapping below illustrates common scenarios and suggested handling:

| Decline Reason | Decline Type | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| `CARD_EXPIRED` | `SOFT_DECLINE` | Prompt customer to update card info |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | `SOFT_DECLINE` | Retry or notify customer |
| `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` | `HARD_DECLINE` | Block and alert security team |
| `INVALID_CARD_NUMBER` | `HARD_DECLINE` | Prompt customer to re-enter details |
| `PROCESSING_ERROR` | `SOFT_DECLINE` | Retry transaction after delay |

<Warning>
Always log declines for auditing and consider adaptive retry strategies for soft declines.
