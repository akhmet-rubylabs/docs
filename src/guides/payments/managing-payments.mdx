## Centralized Payment Records

At the core of PayNext's architecture is `payment`, centralized, source-of-truth ledger for all transaction activity. Every payment, regardless of outcome, is logged in detail for transparency, reconciliation, and analytics.

**Each payment record includes:**

- **Status**: `PENDING`, `AUTHORIZED`, `SETTLING`/`SETTLED`, `FAILED`/`DECLINED`, `CANCELLED`.
- **Amount & Currency**: Total charged and the transaction currency.
- **Payment Method**: Linked ID to stored card or PayPal method in the `payment_methods` table.
- **Error Metadata**: For failed transactions, structured fields like `decline_type`, `decline_reason`, and `gateway_response` help categorize and analyze errors.
- **Gateway Attributes**: Flexible JSON fields store provider-specific response data for advanced troubleshooting or compliance needs.
- **and many more, check our [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction/getting-started)**

<Note>
This centralized approach ensures complete audit trails and enables sophisticated reporting across all payment channels.

All payment data is automatically indexed and searchable, allowing for quick resolution of customer inquiries and operational issues.
