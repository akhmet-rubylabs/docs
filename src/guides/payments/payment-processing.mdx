PayNext enables secure and reliable processing of both one-time and recurring payments. Our system abstracts the complexity of integrating with payment gateways while giving you full control over customer billing logic, retry behavior, and payment tracking.

---

## Supported Payment Methods

PayNext supports the following methods through direct or third-party integrations:

- **Card Payments**: Credit/debit cards across major networks
- **Google Pay & Apple Pay**: Tokenized digital wallet support
- **PayPal**: For both one-time and recurring billing agreements

<Note>
Subscription plans are stored, and recurring logic is managed within PayNextâ€”giving you full control over the entire billing experience.
</Note>

## One-time vs. Recurring Payments

### One-time Payments

You can create one-time charges using the POST /payments endpoint. This is suitable for single transactions like upgrades or top-ups. If it's the first payment for a customer, it must be made using the SDK and a client session.

<Tip>
For subsequent charges, you can call the API directly using the existing customer and plan, without needing a client session.
</Tip>

### Recurring Payments

For subscriptions, PayNext stores the billing plan and manages the schedule internally. Each billing cycle triggers an automatic charge using the saved payment method.

## Payment Lifecycle

Every payment goes through a lifecycle of states:

/>

<Check>
Each transition is logged with a timestamp and metadata (like PSP response, customer ID, retry attempt) for full observability.
</Check>

## Retry Logic

If a payment fails, PayNext distinguishes between:

- **Soft Declines**: Temporary issues (e.g. insufficient funds, network timeout). These are automatically retried based on retry rules (e.g. delay, max attempts).
- **Hard Declines**: Permanent issues (e.g. stolen card, closed account). These are not retried.

<Info>
Refer to the [Decline Codes](./decline-codes) section for more detail.
