- **Payload Structure:**  
  The `payload` varies based on event type:
  
  - For subscriptions: Includes full details like plan, status, and metadata
  - For payments: Contains transaction data, amount, status, and refund details
  - More details you can find under our Webhook documentation [link]

- **Security & Reliability:**  
  Webhooks are secured using bearer tokens and delivered consistently even for updates made through internal tools like the CRM.
