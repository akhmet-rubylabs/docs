PayNext simplifies the process of building recurring or one-off pricing plans. Instead of building pricing logic into every product separately, developers and product teams can centralize plan configuration via dashboard and pass just the `planId` to generate subscriptions.

---

## Overview

Plans in PayNext represent billable offerings such as a monthly subscription, a one-time service fee, or a trial-based product. 

Each plan includes:

- A unique`planId` (auto-generated).
- Billing type (Recurring or One-time).
- Billing interval (for recurring).
- Trial period settings (optional).
- Currency and country-based pricing rules.

Once created, plans can be referenced in your checkout or API requests using just the`planId`. The system automatically resolves localized pricing and trial logic.

---

## When to Use This

Use the **Plans** system when you want to:

- Let non-developers configure pricing across products.
- Avoid duplicating billing logic in multiple environments.
- Manage currency rules and trial periods centrally.
- Reduce the number of API calls needed to set up subscriptions.

## Types of Plans

### Recurring Plans ("Recurring")

Used for products or services billed on a regular schedule (monthly, yearly, etc.). 

You can:

- Set billing frequency (e.g., every 30 days).
- Add a trial period (optional).
- Localize pricing by country and currency.

### One-Time Plans ("One-off")

Used for one-off charges (e.g., setup fee, coaching session). 

You can:

- Set static pricing.
- Localize prices by country and currency.
- Skip interval and trial logic.

## How It Works

### Step 1 – Plan Details

| Field     | Description                                              |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan Type | Choose between **Recurring** or **One-time**             |
| Plan Name | Internal identifier (e.g., "Pro Monthly", "US One-Time") |

### Step 2 – Billing Frequency (Recurring Only)

Define how often customers will be charged: 

Every [ 30 ] [ Days | Months | Years ]

<Info>
  If a customer starts a plan on January 30, and the next month doesn't have that date (e.g. February), they will be charged on the last valid date (Feb 28 or 29).
</Info>

### Step 3 – Accepted Currencies

Each plan must define at least one **default currency**. 

You can then create localized overrides for specific countries.

#### Example:

| Country       | Currency | Amount |
| :------------ | :------- | :----- |
| Default (All) | EUR      | €100   |
| Spain         | EUR      | €90    |
| US            | USD      | \$100  |

<Info>
  When a country is assigned to a specific price rule, it’s excluded from the default pricing rule.
</Info>

### Step 4 – Trial Period (Optional)

For recurring plans only.

| Field          | Description                                                   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trial Toggle   | Enable or disable trial support                               |
| Trial Duration | Number of calendar days (e.g., 7)                             |
| Trial Pricing  | Optional localized trial pricing (same logic as main pricing) |

## Integration via API

Once the plan is created, you only need to pass the `planId` in your session or subscription request. For how plan data is used in session creation and rendering checkout logic, refer to the [Client Session documentation](https://docs.paynext.com/api-reference/client-session/create-a-new-client-session).
