Whether you are operating a SaaS, membership service, or billing automation, our system keeps subscription data centralized and up-to-date.

## Subscription Statuses

Every subscription in PayNext goes through a clear lifecycle. These states are surfaced visually in the Customers page (as shown in the CRM UI), and updated in real time by the backend scheduler.

**The possible statuses include:**

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Trial** | The user is in a free trial period. No charges have been made. |
| **Active** | The subscription is live, and recurring billing is enabled. |
| **Past Due** | A payment attempt failed. The system is retrying the charge. |
| **Scheduled for Cancellation** | A cancellation is queued for the end of the billing period. |
| **Cancelled** | The subscription is terminated and no longer billed. |

<Note>
These statuses appear directly in the Customers tab for each subscription instance.

## Creating & Managing Subscriptions

### Activating a Subscription

You can create subscriptions:

- Via the SDK by providing a `plan` when creating a client session (used during the first payment)
- Via API using `POST /subscriptions` for users who have already completed their first payment

<Check>
Each subscription is tied to a customer and a plan.
</Check>

### Handling Trials

If the selected plan includes a trial, the subscription enters `trial` state upon creation.

### Upgrades & Downgrades

To change a customer's plan:

- Use the "Change Plan" action in the CRM dashboard.
- For API-based updates, refer to our API documentation [link].

<Note>
The system keeps the original billing dates and applies the new plan pricing in the next billing cycle.
</Note>

### Handling Cancellations

Currently, subscriptions can only be canceled immediately.

You can cancel a subscription:

- Via the **CRM dashboard** using the **"Cancel"** action
- Through the API using the `POST /subscriptions/cancel/{id}` endpoint

## Dunning & Retry Logic

If a recurring payment fails, PayNext triggers **automated retries** via its Scheduler service:

1. **Soft Decline** → Retry in XY days (configurable)
2. **Hard Decline / Card Expired** → Retry skipped, alert shown for the first payment
3. If retries fail → Subscription status moves to `past_due`, then `cancelled` after final attempt

<Info>
This ensures revenue recovery while minimizing manual intervention.

## CRM Controls for Subscriptions

The CRM interface (see Customers screen) lets your team:

- View all customer subscriptions in one place
- See current plan, price, status, and billing day
- Filter by status (Trial, Active, Past Due, etc.)
- Open individual records for deeper billing history or edits

<Check>
The CRM provides complete visibility into subscription operations without requiring technical intervention.
</Check>

## API Endpoints for Subscription Management

Refer to our [Public API documentation](../../api-reference/introduction/getting-started).
