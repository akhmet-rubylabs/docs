All API requests require authentication using your organization's API key. The API uses <code>api key</code> authentication to ensure secure access to your billing data.

## Generating Your API Key

1. Navigate to your [organization dashboard](https://dev.paynext.com/dashboard/developers)
2. Click **"New API Key"**
3. Copy your API key securely - it won't be shown again
4. Store it in a secure environment variable

<Warning>
  **Keep Your API Key Secure**: Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Always use environment variables and server-side implementations.
</Warning>

## API Key Types

#### Organization API Key

- **Purpose**: Primary authentication for all billing operations
- **Scope**: Full access to client-session, payments, subscriptions and customers

#### Authentication Header Format

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api-dev.paynext.com/v1/api/<ENDPOINT>' \
  --header 'Authentication: <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
